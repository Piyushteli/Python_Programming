**100 Days of Code – Python Programming**

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! This repository documents my progress as I learn and practice Python programming over 100 days,The course materials and exercises are based on Code with Harry tutorials.

**Repository Structure**

I have divided my 100 days of code into **two Folders:**

**Python_Programming_Part1** :–Covers the fundamentals of Python, including basic syntax and data types, loops and functions, the enumerate() function, file handling, exception handling, basic Python programming exercises, and more.
