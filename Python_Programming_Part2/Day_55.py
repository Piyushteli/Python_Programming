"""
Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Python  (OOPS)
Mainly two approches that are used to write program or code
1)procedural programming
2)Object Oriented Programming


class:-
    A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.It defines the Properties and methods of an Object

Object:
    An Object is an instance of a class and if contains its own data and methods

There are four pillars of the object oriented programming

1)Inheritance:
    Inheritance allows a class(called child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class(called a parent class)

2)Polymorphism:
     polymorphism means same object having different behaviour

3)encapsulation:
    Encapsulation is the process of bundling attributes and methods within a single unit

4)Abstraction:
    Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user.
